# Global-Air-Quality-Data---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

This project explores **global air quality data** using the `city_day.csv` dataset.   The analysis focuses on **Air Quality Index (AQI)** and pollutant levels across cities, seasons, and months.
## 🔎 Key Insights
- **Top 10 most polluted cities** by average AQI  
- Seasonal air quality trends (Winter, Summer, Monsoon)  
- Monthly AQI variations  
- **Weekend vs Weekday** air quality comparison  
- Correlation between major pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NOx, SO2, O3, etc.  
- **City-wise pollutant contribution** for the top 5 polluted cities  

## 📊 Visualizations
The notebook/script generates several plots:
- Bar chart of the top polluted cities  
- Line chart of monthly AQI trends for major cities  
- Heatmap of pollutant correlations  
- Seasonal AQI comparison boxplot  
- Pollutant contribution stacked bar chart  
- City-wise AQI boxplot  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
